# Carbon-Emission-for-US-China-and-India
To find CO2 emission patterns of United States, China and India from 1990 to 2020 Using SQL

Project name: To find CO2 emission patterns of United States, China and India from 1990 to 2020 using SQL
database: project_1 
table: carbon_emission
Data source: 
1. CO2 emission data - https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?end_year=2020&gases=co2&start_year=1990

--It has been understood that US, China and India emitts most of the CO2.
-- On studying the emissions of United States, there has been not much of a decrease.
  --  The minimum and maxmum was found to be 4099.07 and 5367.14 resectively and corresponds to 2020 and 2000 respectively.

-- On studying the emissions of China, it is increasing with year with the least (1826.08) in 1990 and maximum(10296.8) in 2020
-- On studying the emissions of India, it is increasing with year with the least (515.48) in 1995 and maximum(2165.2) in 2020

-- On comparing the three countries it can be clearly seen that China emitts the most and the rate is alarmly increasing.
  -- Also for India the emission rate is increasing but not as much as China where China's emission is almost 5x times as that of India.
  -- For United States, they managed  to keep the emissin around 4000 mtco2e from 1990 to 2020.
  -- The average of emissions were 4793.397 for United States, 5807.772 for China and 1381.958 for India (only first 3 decimal places considered).

-- Graphs has been plotted for the carbon emission of the 3 countries from 1990 to 2020.
